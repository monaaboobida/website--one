<h2>It's me, mona</h2>
<p>Once upon a time, there was a dog carrying a piece in his mouth to eat it in peace at home. On his way home, he had to cross a plank lying across a running brook. As he crossed, he looked down and saw his own shadow reflected in the water beneath. Thinking it was another dog with another piece of meat, he made up his mind to have that also. So he made a snap at the shadow in the water, but as he opened his mouth the piece of meat fell out, dropped into the water and was never seen anymore. Beware lest you lose the substance by grasping at the shadow

<p class="text"> mists of prehistory have been wall-conscious; from the Neolithic period – when ramparts of pounded earth were used – to the Communist Revolution, walls were an essential part of any village. Not only towns and villages; the houses and the temples within them were somehow walled, and the houses also had no windows overlooking the street, thus giving the feeling of wandering around a huge maze. </p>
